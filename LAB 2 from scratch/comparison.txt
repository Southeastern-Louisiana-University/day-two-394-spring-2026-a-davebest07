Build Image (Linux base with Go installed):
- Image name: go-build-only
- Base image: ubuntu:22.04
- Purpose: Compile the Go binary
- Size: ~700–900 MB (large due to OS, Go toolchain, and build dependencies)

Run Image (Final image):
- Image name: go-from-scratch
- Base image: alpine
- Purpose: Run the compiled Go binary only
- Size: 16.1 MB (Content size: 5.03 MB)

Using a multi-stage build significantly reduces the final image size by
excluding the Go compiler and build dependencies from the runtime image.
Only the compiled binary is copied into the final Alpine image.

Final image disk usage: 16.1 MB
Final image content size: 5.03 MB
